  "Transcript": "[[A cutaway view of a \"ground\" which is actually made up of layers labeled with various groups of files as one might see on a random person's computer fills the frame, such as \"Documents, 47 GB\" and \"High School Zip Disk, 94 MB\". A small crevice leads down through the middle, to a cave-like area where a figure stands looking through the smallest grouping of files. A second figure with long hair stands at ground level, looking down into the crevice.]]\nLong-haired Figure: You okay down there?\nSubterranean Figure: Oh my god. I wrote *poetry*.\n\n{{Title text: Wow, ANIMORPHS-NOVEL.RTF? Just gonna, uh, go through and delete that from all my archives real quick.}}"

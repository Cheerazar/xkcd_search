That's how I got kicked out of the ACM in college.\nPerson: . . . what?\nHat Guy: During a competition, I told the programmers on our team that e^pi-pi was a standard test of floating-point handlers--it would come out to 20 unless they had rounding errors.\nPerson: That's awful.\nHat Guy: Yeah, they dug through half their algorithms looking for the bug before they figured it out.\n{{alt text: Also, I hear the 4th root of (9^2 + 19^2\n22) is pi."
